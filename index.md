---

R/qtl2 (aka qtl2) is a reimplementation of the QTL analysis software
[R/qtl](https://rqtl.org), to better handle high-dimensional data
and complex cross designs.  It is split
into [qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno) (for calculating
genotype probabilities, imputations, and genetic maps),
[qtl2scan](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2scan) (for QTL genome scans and
related calculations), and
[qtl2plot](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2plot) (for data visualization).
A further package, [qtl2convert](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2convert),
contains functions for converting data among the R/qtl2,
[DOQTL](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DOQTL.html),
and [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org) formats, for example to convert genotype
probabilities produced by DOQTL to the format needed by qtl2scan, or
to convert qtl2scan results to the format produced by `scanone` in
R/qtl, so that they may be graphed with the R/qtl functions.

![Warning](assets/pics/warning_icon.png)

In R/qtl2 version 0.5, we made major revisions to some of the
central data structures, and a number of steps in QTL analyses have
changed. See the revised
[user guide](assets/vignettes/user_guide.html), or
[this description of the changes in version 0.5](assets/vignettes/version05_new.html).
A couple of functions for converting objects from the format for
Rqtl2 version 0.4 and the new format are in
[`convert_04_to_05.R`](assets/convert_04_to_05.R).

### Discussion group

For discussion/questions about R/qtl2, join the
[rqtl2-disc google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rqtl2-disc).
Or join [rqtl-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rqtl-announce)
for announcements about R/qtl and R/qtl2.
(We'll try to keep the original
[rqtl-disc group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rqtl-disc)
for the discussion/questions about the original R/qtl only.)

### Installation

First, make sure you have the latest version of
[R (3.4.1)](https://cran-r.project.org).

R/qtl2 is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), but
it can be installed from a mini-CRAN at [rqtl.org](https://rqtl.org).

    install.packages("qtl2", repos="https://rqtl.org/qtl2cran")

The [qtl2](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2) package is
inspired by the
[tidyverse package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse);
it is basically empty, but when you install it, the
[qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno),
[qtl2scan](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2scan),
[qtl2plot](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2plot), and
[qtl2convert](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2convert) packages, plus a
bunch of dependencies, will be installed.

Alternatively, you can install R/qtl2 from its source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rqtl). (But note that compiling the C++
code can be rather slow.)

On _Windows_, you'll need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

On _Mac OS X_, you'll need the
[command-line developer tools](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/install-command-line-developer-tools-without-xcode-0168115/),
as well as [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS).

You then need to install the
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, plus a set of
package dependencies: [yaml](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yaml),
[jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite),
[data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table),
and [RcppEigen](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen).
(Additional, secondary dependencies will also be installed.)

    install.packages(c("devtools", "yaml", "jsonlite", "data.table", "RcppEigen"))

Finally, install R/qtl2 using `devtools::install_github()`.

    library(devtools)
    install_github("rqtl/qtl2")
